# ROR 2 Dev Tools
Tools that should be running as a person develops this application.
Since everyone has their preferences in what they need to see, the tools are split into seperate scripts.
If you just want everything to run in a single glob, you can use the `dev.sh` script.
Otherwise, pick and choose what pieces are running.
